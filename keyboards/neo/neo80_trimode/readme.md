# Neo80 Tri-mode
The Neo80 Tri-mode is based on a Westberry Tech WB32FQ95 MCU in a LQFP64 
package and can be programmed with wb32-dfu. The keyboard uses a WCH CH582F 
chip running a proprietary firmware to provide wireless connectivity. This is 
a community port which was derived from a partial source originally released 
by the manufacturer and reverse engineered by probing the hardware directly.


## Flashing a new firmware
Hold ESCAPE [0,0] to enter bootloader mode while inserting the USB cable into
the keyboard. Then run the following to flash the firmware.
```shell
make neo/neo80_trimode:default:flash
```


## Quirks
The Neo80 uses a slightly different way to initialize the bluetooth device
names. As the wireless stack is initialized in `keyboard_post_init_kb` a call
is made to `md_send_devinfo` where the bluetooth name is passed but with the
`$` character as the last character. The `$` is replaced with the BT device
number when pairing. This seems to be a feature unique to this version of the
CH582F firmware. This also means during pairing we do not 'CLEAN' the device
and we do not upddate the device name. We simply send PAIR to `md_send_devctrl`.


## What wireless chip is the Neo80 using?
The Neo80 uses a WCH CH582F running a custom firmware to provide wireless
connectivity. The CH582F is attached to UART1 on the WB32FQ92.

## What flash is the WB32FQ95 using on the Neo80?
The WB32FQ95 on the Ne80 is using a Puya P25D80SH serial flash.
* QSPI
   * QSPI_SCK  is on PB3
   * QSPI_MISO is on PB4
   * QSPI_MOSI is on PB5


## WB32FQ95 which UART is the Neo80 using?
The WB32FQ95 supports 3 UARTS since PA2 and PA3 are used by the matrix we can
rule UART2 out. Probing reveals the UART1 is used to connect to the CH582F.
* UART1 (SD1)
   * UART1_TX is on PA9
   * UART1_RX is on PA10
* UART2 (SD2)
   * UART2_TX is on PA2
   * UART2_RX is on PA3
* UART3 (SD3)
   * UART3_TX is on PC10
   * UART3_RX is on PC11


## What battery charging circuit is present?
A TP4056 IC is onboard which is used for battery charging and management.


## How are the LEDs wired?
* PD2 is wired to the ESC LED
* PA8 is wired to the CAPSLOCK LED
* PC11 is wired to the Q LED
* PC10 is wired to the W LED
* PA15 is wired to the E LED
* PC0 is wired to the R LED
